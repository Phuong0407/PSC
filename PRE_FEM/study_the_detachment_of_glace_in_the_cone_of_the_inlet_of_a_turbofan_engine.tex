\begin{problem}
    The inlet of a turbofan engine is modeled as a cylinder of height $H_2$ and radius $R_2$. Inside the cylinder, there is a cone of base radius $R_1$ and height $H_1$. At the entrance of the cylinder, there is a uniform axial flow of velocity $U_{\infty}$. The surface of a cone, is   with a layer of ice, with the profile.

For the sake of simplicity, we suppose that an ice piece has the shape of a box with size $a \times b \times c$. The ice piece moves as a blunt object in the flow field, where its size is supposed to be negligible as compared to the characteristic length of the inlet. Therefore, it affects the flow field as perturbation terms and in this first insight, we neglect its effect to the flow field. Therefore, the flow field, characterized by a velocity field $\underline{u}(x, y, z)$, a pressure field $p(x, y, z)$. This field impacts the ice piece through the aerodynamics coefficient $C_D$, $C_L$ and $C_M$.

An ice piece is characterized by its position $(x, y, z)$ and by its orientation in space $()
