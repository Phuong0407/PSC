We consider a right rectangular prism of dimension $L, W, H$ with the frame at the center of the prism as $x$ $y$, $z$. The ice has initial position is $x_0, y_0, z_0$ in the flow field. The flow field is prescribed by the variable $u(x,y,z,t)$, $v(x,y,z,t)$, $w(x,y,z,t)$ and pressure $p(x,y,z,t)$. We consider the frame of reference as the fixed within the inlet.

\begin{align*}
\diff{^2\underline{r}}{t^2} = \dfrac{1}{2}\rho_0 \left\|\diff{\underline{r}}{t}-\underline{u}(\underline{r})\right\|^2 \underline{C}_A + 
\end{align*}
