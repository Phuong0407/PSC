\chapter{Flow Field Computation}

We will compute the flow field of the airflow within the inlet of the engine. To this end, a full-computation of the domain by Navier-Stokes equation is the supreme approach. However, computation of the whole Navier-Stokes equation without any approximation seems computationally costs as problem does not pose any unstable effect. We will justify this fact later. Now, a proposal of geometric configuration of the flow field is as follow:
\beg
